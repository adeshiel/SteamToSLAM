# SteamToSLAM
## Project for CS591: MEAN Stack Development

---

After being yelled at by your parents for playing too many video games and having your gaming system taken away, what is there to do? They tell you to go read a book or maybe dedicate that time to a show. As long as you’re not glued to your games, they don’t care. My project SteamToSLAM takes your Steam username and forms a list of recommendations of shows, literature, anime, and movies based on your most recently played games - in the case where you comply with your parent’s demand.
